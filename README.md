# Firefly-Synchronization

A simulation of the collective phenomena known as firefly synchronization in which the flash of one firefly encourages others to want to do so, resulting in large groups of fireflies flashing in sync.

To run simulation:

```python fireflies.py```

- [x] Implement basic synchronization based on randomly generated flash urge
- [x] Add a color trait to spread among synchronized fireflies
- [ ] Add glow circle to emit from each firefly
- [ ] Change urge to only increase upon a neighbor's flash rather than a complete urge reset
